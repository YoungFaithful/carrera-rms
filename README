How to get the rms.py to run:

This is based on a Ubuntu Distribution

Install all the dependencies:

(1. sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev)
2. sudo apt install python3-pip
3. sudo pip3 install setuptools carreralib bluepy pyqt5 flask python-vlc


Starting the Application:

Get the CU BT Address with the command:
prompt> hcitool lescan


Start the RMS with the CU Address as a command line option:
promt> cd /<local folder with rms.py>
prompt> python3 rms.py <CU BT or USB Address>

for example in Ubuntu:
promt>  python3 rms.py dev/ttyUSB0
  
  ensure user has the rights to write and read ttyUSB0 otherwise give him rights to do so or use sudo
  promt> sudo chmod a+rwx /dev/ttyUSB0

or

prompt> python3 rms.py
and input the CU BT Address in the Window that pops up
or select the CU with a mouse Click in case QtBluetooth is working properly

Happy Slotting
