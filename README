How to get the rms.py to run:

This is based on a Ubuntu Distribution

1. apt-get install libglib2.0-dev
2. apt-get install python3-pip
3. pip3 install carreralib
4. pip3 install setuptools

Starting the Application:

Get the CU BT Address with the command:

Start the RMS with the CU Address as a command line option:

for example in Ubuntu:
  python3 rms.py dev/ttyUSB0
  
ensure user has the rights to write and read ttyUSB0 otherwise give him rights to do so or use sudo

or

prompt> python3 rms.py
and input the CU BT Address in the Window that pops up
or select the CU with a mouse Click in case QtBluetooth is working properly
